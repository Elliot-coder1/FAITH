              <p class="text-burlywood-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                  This past weekend, I had the incredible honor of attending the Umuofia Art and Book Festival—a celebration not just of literature and art, but of legacy, culture, and courageous storytelling.

                    From the moment I arrived, I could feel the spirit of Chinua Achebe pulsing through the air—through the murals, the poetry recitations, the vibrant panel discussions, and the gathering of writers who, like me, have drawn strength from his words.
              </p>

              </p>

              <p class="text-burlywood-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                   I was invited to speak about my book, Impunity—a story that deals with the uncomfortable, the ignored, and the deeply human. Talking about this book in front of an audience that got it—that understood the necessity of naming injustice—was both humbling and affirming.
              </p>
              
              
              
              <p class="text-burlywood-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            People asked me:

                    Why write this?
                    Was it hard?
                    Did you feel safe telling these stories?
                    
                    And the answer is: it was never easy. But it was necessary.
                    
                    There’s something powerful about standing in a room of thinkers, artists, and truth-tellers—where silence is not demanded but dismantled. I got to peel back the layers of Impunity, from the raw inspiration to the discomfort of truth-telling, and that made every hour spent writing worth it.
                    
                    The Writer’s Block That Tried to Win
                    
                    During my panel session, someone asked:
                    
                    How did you overcome writer’s block?
                    
                    I laughed—because honestly, sometimes I didn’t. I sat with it. I hated it. Then I surrendered to the fact that not writing is still part of the writing process.
                    
                    There were months when the manuscript stared at me in judgment. But slowly, I learned that creativity isn’t a tap—it’s a river. Sometimes it flows; sometimes it waits. But when it moves, you better be ready.
                    
                    That’s how Impunity was born—not just through fire, but through stillness.
                    
                    A Festival Like No Other
                    
                    The Umuofia Art and Book Festival wasn’t just an event—it was an encounter. An awakening. A beautiful rebellion against erasure. We honored Chinua Achebe, but we also celebrated the next generation of fearless storytellers—of which I am proud to be a part.
                    
                    To everyone who listened, bought my book, asked questions, and shared their own stories—thank you. You reminded me why I do this.

              <p class="text-burlywood-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                 Recently in Benin City, the Battle of Stanzas—a poetry and spoken word extravaganza
co-hosted by Naija Poetry Fest and the Benin Writers Society—became the stage for a
landmark literary moment. There, celebrated fiction writer Faith Ose Ebhodaghe (author of
Impunity) stepped into the spotlight to perform two yet-to-be-published poems: “In
Remembrance of Adesuwa” and “Idia Manifesto.” Her reading was featured in the first anthology
born of the event, Stanzas from the Bronze Capital, which showcases creative reflections rooted
in the rich heritage and modern pulse of Benin City.

              <p class="text-burlywood-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                 Context and Cultural Significance;
The Battle of Stanzas—a poetic renaissance—was held at the Edo Creative Hub, Sir Victor
Uwaifo Creative Hub, Airport Road, Benin City, on August 30, 2025. The event brought together
poets, spoken word artists, and literary creatives to celebrate and contribute to a growing literary
community in Edo State. Central to the event was the unveiling of the anthology Stanzas from
the Bronze Capital, a collection intended to poetically archive the soul of Benin City—its
mythology, heritage, present-day struggles, and cultural identity.
              </p>
              
              <p class="text-burlywood-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                  Faith Ose Ebhodaghe’s Contribution;
In this convergence of voices, Faith Ose Ebhodaghe offered a poignant addition: “In
Remembrance of Adesuwa” and “Idia Manifesto”, both debuting for the first time. These poems
are part of her broader essay-based creative project—though not quite framed as an anthology
yet, they’re strongly thematic and deeply rooted in Edo cultural narratives.
              </p>

              
              <p class="text-burlywood-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                  While her published fiction, such as the novel Impunity, has already made waves—highlighting
systemic power, corruption, and resilience—these poems mark a personal, poetic doorway into
her ongoing exploration of history, memory, and identity.
              </p>

               <p class="text-burlywood-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                 What It Means for Her and the Community;
This appearance signifies more than just a performance; it positions Ebhodaghe at the
intersection of fictional narrative and poetic heritage. By contributing to Stanzas from the Bronze
Capital, she aligns her creative voice with the collective literary expression of Edo’s past and
present.
              </p>

              <p class="text-burlywood-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                 Readers and attendees alike are invited to glimpse the evolution of her work—from gripping
fiction to lyrical evocation. The poems “In Remembrance of Adesuwa” and “Idia Manifesto”
suggest a blending of historical homage (Adesuwa, possibly referencing a figure from Benin
lore) and artistic manifesto—what might be called a vision for cultural reawakening.
              </p>

             <p class="text-burlywood-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              As Stanzas from the Bronze Capital takes its place among contemporary anthologies, its
contributors—led by strong voices like Faith Ose Ebhodaghe—offer readers a layered tapestry
of Benin’s identity. For those following Ebhodaghe’s journey from Impunity to these newly
unveiled poems, there’s a compelling trajectory: a writer grounding her creative force in both
narrative and poetic tradition.
